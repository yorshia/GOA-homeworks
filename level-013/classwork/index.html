        <p>In common usage, randomness is the apparent or actual lack of definite pattern or predictabilit
            y in information.[1][2] A random sequence of events, symbols or steps often has no order and does not fo
            llow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are, by definition, unpredictable, but if there is a
             known probability distribution, the frequency of different outcomes over repeated events (or "trials") is predictable.[note 1] For example, when
              throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will tend to occur twice as often as 4. In this view, 
            randomness is not haphazardness; it is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome. Randomness applies to concepts of chance, probab
            ility, and information entropy.


The fields of mathematics, probability, and statistics use formal definitions of randomness, typically assuming that there is some 'objective' probability dist
ribution. In statistics, a random variable is an assignment of a numerical value to each possible outcome of an event space. This association facilitates the identi
fication and the calculation of probabilities of the events. Random variables can appear in random sequences. A random process is a sequence of random variables whose outcome
s do not follow a deterministic pattern, but follow an evolution described by probability distributions. These and other constructs are extremely useful in probability theory and 
the various applications of randomness.</p>

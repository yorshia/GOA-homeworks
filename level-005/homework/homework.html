<h2>history</h2>
<p>According to the breed standard of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, the Cane Corso was once distributed throughout much
     of the Italian peninsula, but in the recent past was found only in Puglia, in southern Italy.[2][3] After the collapse of the mezzadria
      system of share-cropping in the 1960s, the dogs became rare. The modern breed derives from selective breeding from about 1980 of a few surviving animals.[4]

A breed society, the Società Amatori Cane Corso, was formed in 1983.[5]: 107 [6] The breed was recognised by the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia 
Italiana in 1994;[4] it was provisionally accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1996, and
 received full acceptance in 2007.[7] It was recognised by the American Kennel Club of the United States in 2010.[8]

In the period 2011–2019 the number of annual registrations in Italy was in the range of 3000–4250.[9]

<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>The Cane Corso is a large dog of molossoid type, and is closely related to the Neapolitan Mastiff. It is well muscled[8] 
    and less bulky than most other mastiff breeds. According to the international standard, dogs should stand some 62–70 cm at 
    the withers and weigh 45–50 kg; bitches are about 4 cm smaller, and weigh some 5 kg less.[2]

The head is large, slightly over one third of the height at the withers in length, with a well-defined stop.
 The top of the cranium is flat and slightly convergent to the muzzle. The eyes are oval in shape, and set well apart. The iris of the eye should be as dark as possible.[3]

The coat is short, dense and lustrous. It may be black, various shades of grey (lead-grey, light grey or 
slate-grey) or fawn (dark fawn, light fawn, or stag red), or dark wheaten ('fromentino'); it may be brindled. Minor white markings on the chest, the feet or the nose are tolerated.</p>
